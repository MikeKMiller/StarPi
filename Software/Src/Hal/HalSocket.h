/**
HalWebsocketd provides an interface to the websocketd. 
This will queue messages from websocketd ready to be used and queue 
messages to be sent. The send queue will update messages in the queue 
with the same Id instead of adding another item to the queue. 
Each time the run function is called, a message will be taken from 
the queue and sent to websocketd
